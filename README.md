## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to perform an in-depth analysis of stock market data for various companies. The analysis includes:
- Visualization of stock prices.
- Exploration of statistical properties of features.
- Predictive modeling to forecast future stock prices for any given stock.

## Dataset

The project can be applied to any stock market dataset. Ensure the dataset is properly formatted (e.g., `csv` format) and contains relevant columns like `Open`, `Close`, `High`, `Low`, `Volume`, and `Date`.

## Installation

To run this project locally, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure your stock market dataset (e.g., `your_stock_data.csv`) is in the project directory.
3. Modify the script to load your dataset.
4. Run the Python script to perform data analysis and model training.

```bash
python untitled20.py
```

Features

- Data Exploration: Descriptive statistics and data information.
- Data Visualization: Plots for stock prices and feature distributions.
- Feature Engineering: Addition of new features like `is_quarter_end`.
- Machine Learning: Training models like Logistic Regression, SVM, and XGBoost for predictive analysis.

Technologies Used

- Python: Programming language.
- NumPy: For numerical operations.
- Pandas: For data manipulation.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Seaborn: For advanced data visualization.
- Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning models.
- XGBoost: For gradient boosting models.
